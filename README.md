# URDF

URDF is an erlang application providing tools to convert RDF triples back and forth with:

* json-ld
* n3
* xml rdf

## Json-ld

This processor is heavily inspired from the python version written by [Bradley Allen](https://github.com/bradleypallen/json_ld_processor).

The goal is to be able to convert JSON-LD documents to N-triples.

### Credits
Thanks for Bradley Allen.

### Specification
You can find the current JSON-LD draft [here](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/).
